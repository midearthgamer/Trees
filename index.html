        <h1 class="title">Ode to Trees</h1>
        <p class="poem-text"><p>Trees stand tall and proud,</p>
          <p>Their leaves rustling in the breeze,</p>
          <p>A home to many creatures,</p>
          <p>A beauty that never cease.</p>
          <p>
          ‎
          </p>
          <p>They provide us shade and oxygen,</p>
          <p>And help us breathe clean air,</p>
          <p>A symbol of life and growth,</p>
          <p>A gift that's beyond compare.</p>
          ‎
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>Oh trees, how we adore thee,</p>
          <p>May you forever flourish and thrive,</p>
          <p>For without you, this world would be,</p>
          <p>A place much less alive.</p>
